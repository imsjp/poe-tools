Trade macros are external tools that allow players to check item values and trade for items with other players more easily.

### Recommended: Awakened PoE Trade
[Awakened PoE Trade](https://snosme.github.io/awakened-poe-trade/download) is a third-party tool that can be easily installed for both Windows and Linux. It features a price checking function that uses real-time data and predictions to give players an estimate of item value.

The tool updates automatically if you use the installer on Windows.

One caveat of using Awakened PoE Trade is that the game must be ran in Windowed or Windowed Fullscreen mode.

The most common hotkeys:

- Pressing `Ctrl+D` while hovering over an item will allow you to price check the item.

- Pressing `Shift+Space` will open the tool's in-game overlay where you'll find the settings.
