Loot filters allow you to decrease the amount of items that appear on the ground for you to click. This increases in-game efficiency with less time spent looking at low-value items.

## NeverSink Loot Filters

The most popular loot filters used in the game are created by NeverSink and can be found on [his PathofExile profile](https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/NeverSink/item-filters). At the top-right corner of each filter level, select 'FOLLOW'.

The filters will populate when you login to the game in the options menu.

The 'strict' level filter is the recommended item filter for most players.

As an example of how the loot filters work:

As of Patch 3.15, players can hide filtered items from rendering as drops. This increases in-game performance by a large margin, making loot filters even more important.

### Customizing Loot Filters

NeverSink, the creator of the most-popular loot filters, has a public website for players to customize loot filters as they wish. 

The website is called [FilterBlade](https://www.filterblade.xyz/) and provides a wide variety of customization from colors palettes to new drop sounds.

If the default filters don't match the colors you'd like, feel free to customize them to your liking!
