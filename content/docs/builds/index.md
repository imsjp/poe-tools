## Choosing Your Class

Visit the [Path of Exile Forums](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum) and scroll down to the 'CLASSES/BUILDS' section to view discussions about the seven different classes in the game.

For safe starting builds, look for titles that include phrases such as: "League Starter" and "All content". These words signal that the class guide will be viable for new players to follow in order to clear what the game offers.

It is also important to pay attention to the "[x.xx]" prefix on builds which denotes the version of Path of Exile the build was created for.

## Example of a Class

Here is [an example of a build guide](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2866127) you may come across on the forums. It is a beginner guide by the player Remi for a Ranger class that focuses on the Toxic Rain skill. The build is "all content viable" with in-depth information and covers common questions a player might have while playing the build from level 1 to 100.

## Path of Building Note

Many guides on the forums and around the internet will include a pastebin link for you to import to an external tool called Path of Building. Remi's Toxic Rain guide is no exception. Path of Building (PoB) allows players to view the game's entire skill tree and simulate their skill points and in-game equipment to calculate possible damage. This allows build guide makers to show players where to allocate their skill points and avoid confusion.

The next section of this guide will cover how to install Path of Building and how to import builds with their pastebin links.
